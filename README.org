This repository contains various scripts which I use to facilitate a smooth workflow on GNU/Linux systems.

Most of the scripts in this repository are /Bash/ scripts. If you are using this repository in conjuction with my [[https://github.com/seizeop/dots][dots]] repository make sure to add these scripts to your path by putting them in =~/.local/bin/=. Additionally, for quick execution of the =overrides-gui= control panel you may wish to create a simple desktop file pointing to =overrides-gui= like so: 

#+begin_quote
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Overrides GUI
Comment=Simple GUI for system toggles and themeng
Exec=/home/user/.local/bin/overrides-gui
Icon=face-cool
Type=Application
Terminal=false
#+end_quote
